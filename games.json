The overworld is varied and contains many environments including mountains, lakes, deserts, forests, caves, coastal regions, and a graveyard.

Upon defeating the boss, Link receives a heart container and a piece of the Triforce. There are a total of nine dungeons: eight containing Triforce pieces plus Ganon's fortress.</p><p>The game is also notable for its non-linearity. \"Clues\" are given sporadically by shopkeepers and other <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\"> non-player characters</a>, though the incredibly poor translation means these clues are rarely useful in the English version.

This particular dungeon contains the <a href=\"/bow/3055-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-73\"> bow</a> and the <a href=\"/boomerang/3055-76/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-76\"> boomerang</a>, and its boss is Aquamentus, a green dragon-like creature.</li><li><b>The Moon</b> - The second dungeon is hidden inside a forest in the eastern portion of the world. The only item found in The Moon is the magical boomerang, which can be thrown further than the boomerang. The boss of The Moon is Dodongo.</li><li><b>The Manji</b> - Like The Moon, The Manji is also hidden in a forest, but to the southwestern portion of the world. This dungeon contains the <a href=\"/raft/3055-819/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-819\"> raft</a>, which allows Link to traverse water. The dungeon is guarded by the Manhandla, a large, multi-headed plant creature.</li><li><b>The Snake</b> - The fourth dungeon in the game is located directly west to the first dungeon in the game, on another small island. Here, Link finds the <a href=\"/ladder/3055-520/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-520\"> ladder</a>, which gives the player the ability to cross gaps inside dungeons. The boss of \"The Snake\" is Gleeok, a multi-headed dragon.</li><li><b>The Lizard</b> - The Lizard is located to the northeast, on top of a mountain, only accessible with the previous dungeon's ladder. Here, the player finds the <a href=\"/recorder/3055-820/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-820\"> whistle</a>, which gives Link the ability to warp between dungeons, as well as killing some types of enemies. The boss of The Lizard is Digdogger, a circular, heavily armored creature.</li><li><b>The Dragon</b> - Legend of Zelda's sixth dungeon is located to the far west of the map. In this dungeon, Link finds the <a href=\"/wand/3055-221/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-221\"> magic wand</a>, an equally powerful attack as the boomerang, but one that doesn't require <a href=\"/rupee/3055-44/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-44\"> Rupees</a> to use. The boss of The Dragon is <a href=\"/gohma/3005-7632/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7632\"> Gohma</a>, one of the easiest bosses of the game, and one of few who has resurfaced in future games.</li><li><b>The Demon</b> - The Demon is where the whistle comes into play, an item required to open up a secret passageway beneath a lake to the west. In The Demon, the player finds the <a href=\"/candle/3055-814/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-814\"> red candle</a>, an improvement over the blue candle (found outside of dungeons), allowing Link to burn bushes and enemies indefinitely.</li><li><b>The Lion</b> - Two items are found in the game's eighth dungeon: the magic book and the <a href=\"/magic-key/3055-816/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-816\"> magic key</a>. The book improves the wand, which makes it shoot <a href=\"/fireball/3055-120/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-120\"> fireballs</a> as well, while the magical key is able to open any door in any dungeon.</li><li><b><a href=\"/death-mountain/3035-69/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-69\"> Death Mountain</a></b> - Death Mountain is the final location in the game, and thus, is the largest dungeon in the game.

The game was released in 1985 for the <a href=\"../../nes/60-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. Super Mario Bros. has gone on to be considered by many to be one of the best platformers ever created. The <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/gamers/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition</a>, a record keeping organization, declared Super Mario Bros. for the NES as the <a href=\"../../best-selling-games/92-1525/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> best selling</a> video game of all time with more than 40 million copies sold worldwide.</p><p>Super Mario Bros. has two direct sequels, numerous spin-offs, and has also crossed mediums--most notably into television and movies. <i>Super Mario Bros.</i>, the movie, was the first <a href=\"../../games-on-which-movies-are-based/92-1019/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> movie to be based on a video game</a>. <a href=\"../../mario/94-177/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mario</a>, the main character of the game, is one of Nintendo’s most recognizable mascots, and has become so famous that he is recognized worldwide.</p><p>The game has been released in a variety of forms.

The game's other songs, such as the Starman theme, underwater, underground, the game over jingle, and the castle themes have also been featured in dozens of future games, not limited to the Mario series.</p><h2>Story</h2><p><a href=\"../../the-mushroom-kingdom/95-14/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> The Mushroom Kingdom</a> is invaded by the <a href=\"../../koopa/92-120/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Koopas</a>. The Koopas are a tribe of turtle-like creatures versed in the ways of black magic. Using their black magic abilities they have turned all the Mushroom people into various objects like stones and bricks. Their leader, the evil Koopa King <a href=\"../../bowser/94-337/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bowser</a>, has kidnapped the only person who can undo the black magic that has trapped the Mushroom people, <a href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-709\"> Princess Toadstool</a>. Mario hears of the plight of the Mushroom people, grabs his brother <a href=\"../../luigi/94-370/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Luigi</a>, and sets out on a quest to free Princess Toadstool.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The gameplay of Super Mario Bros. is simple. The game has eight worlds, and each world has four sub-levels. Basically, Mario must travel through all eight worlds, avoiding obstacles and enemies along the way. At the end of each world is a castle, in which Mario must fight one of Bowser’s evil minions; with the exception of the last castle in which Mario fights Bowser himself.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214732\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-214732\"><img alt=\"Mario swims through World 2-2.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/214732-1177890882_03.png 256w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px\" data-width=\"256\"></a><figcaption>Mario swims through World 2-2.</figcaption></figure><p>There were also several chances to <a href=\"../../warping/92-852/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Warp</a> ahead and skip levels. World 1-2 had the ability to warp to Worlds 2, 3 or 4, and World 4-2 had the ability to warp worlds 6, 7 and 8. This allowed for the <a href=\"../../speedrun/92-179/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Speedruns</a> to become common.</p><p>The weapons in Mario's arsenal are not vast by any means. Mario can <a href=\"../../jump/92-379/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> jump</a> on enemy’s heads, shoot <a href=\"../../fireball/93-120/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> fireballs</a> (by picking up a Fire Flower) at them, or use “Star Power” by picking up a Starman, which makes him an <a href=\"../../temporary-invincibility/92-266/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> invincible machine of destruction</a>, laying waste to everything in his path. Mario can also use the occasional <a href=\"../../koopa-shell/93-309/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Koopa shell</a> to kill enemies. This four pronged offensive is how Mario will dispatch of most enemies, with the exception of Bowser and his castle minions. When it comes to the bosses of the game there is another way of dealing with them that is presented. Jumping on their heads will only get Mario killed, and there are no Starmen to be had during these instances. They can be killed with fireballs, if Mario somehow makes it to the end of the level with with that ability; but if Mario doesn't, there aren't many other approaches to dispatching these enemies.</p><p>Mario begins the game with 3 lives, and can earn more by obtaining 1-up mushrooms, collecting 100 <a href=\"../../coin/93-219/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> coins</a>, or by jumping on multiple enemies (or a single enemy multiple times) without touching the ground. It is possible to earn many lives very quickly by using exploits such as repeatedly jumping on a Koopa shell, kicking it into a block, and jumping on it again as it returns. If Mario loses all his lives, the player is returned to the start screen.</p><p>All of the the bosses in the game are standing on bridges over pits of lava, blocking the way to the end of the level. At the end of each bridge is an ax. Using a platform above the boss or running underneath the boss when he jumps, and then touching the ax at the end of the bridge will cause the bridge to collapse, sending the boss into the lava below.</p><p>After each one of the “boss” battles a mushroom retainer (aka <a href=\"../../toads/92-3369/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Toads</a>) is saved who says this <a href=\"../../meme-origin/92-2420/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> famous line</a>, “Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!” The exception is, of course, when Mario finally beats Bowser in World 8-4 and rescues <a href=\"../../princess-peach/94-709/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Princess Peach</a>.</p><h2>Characters</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-177\"> Mario</a> </strong>- Main character of the game.

Mario’s brother and character used by player two when in two player mode.</li><li><strong><a href=\"../../toads/92-3369/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mushroom Retainer (Toads)</a></strong> - The mushroom person that is saved in the castles at the end of each world, with the exception of the last castle.</li><li><strong><a href=\"../../princess-peach/94-709/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Princess Toadstool</a> </strong>- Princess of Mushroom Kingdom and the only one who can undo the Koopa’s black magic.</li></ul><h2>Enemies</h2><ul><li><strong><a href=\"../../blooper/94-2323/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Blooper</a></strong> – Underwater squid-like creatures that must be killed with fireballs.</li><li><strong><a href=\"../../bullet-bill/92-1581/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bullet Bill</a> </strong>– Bullets that are fired, either with a cannon, or off-screen, at Mario.</li><li><strong><a href=\"../../buzzy-beetle/92-3422/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Buzzy Beetle</a></strong> – A tough beetle-like creature with a hard, outer shell that cannot be hurt by fire.</li><li><strong><a href=\"../../cheep-cheep/92-792/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Cheep Cheep</a></strong> – Red and yellow fish with white undersides.

Jumping on this enemy will cause it to go into its shell, and if the shell is then jumped on it will send it traveling either right or left and take out any enemies in its path. This enemy is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods.</li><li><strong><a href=\"../../lakitu/94-927/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Lakitu</a> </strong>– A koopa who rides on a cloud, showering Mario with spiny eggs. These eggs turn into Spinies (see below).</li><li><strong><a href=\"../../koopa-paratroopa/92-2558/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Paratroopa</a> </strong>– Basically Koopa Troopas with wings. When jumped on, they lose their wings and turn into Koopa Troopas. This enemy is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods.</li><li><strong><a href=\"../../spiny/92-3973/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Spiny</a> </strong>– These koopas are thrown by Lakitu, and come covered in spikes. They can be hurt by fireballs, or when touched by a player possessing \"Star-Power.\"</li></ul><h2>Power Ups</h2><ul><li><a href=\"../../1-up/93-77/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 1-UP</a> – A green mushroom that grants Mario an extra life.</li><li><a href=\"../../fire-flower/93-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Fire Flower</a> – Gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs. Mario must already be in the “Super” form to gain the fireball ability; otherwise it has the same affect as the Super Mushroom.</li><li><a href=\"../../starman/93-23/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Starman</a> – Makes Mario or Luigi invincible, with the exception of falling into holes, and grants the ability to kill enemies just by touching them. Normally Mario must jump on an enemy, shoot it with fireballs, or use a Koopa shell to kill them.</li><li><a href=\"../../super-mushroom/93-49/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Super</a> <a href=\"../../super-mushroom/93-49/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mushroom</a> – This makes Mario bigger. In essence it transforms Mario or Luigi into “Super Mario” or “Super Luigi.” It also gives them the ability to take an extra hit; however, when hit they lose the “Super,” and are reduced to regular Mario or Luigi.</li></ul><h2>Notable Ports and Remakes</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/vs-super-mario-bros/3030-25222/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-25222\"> Vs.

Super Mario Bros</a></em>, a positive review.<sup><br /></sup></p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>Super Mario Bros. (and the Nintendo Entertainment System) were released at a major turning point in video game history, shortly after the infamous video game market crash in 1983 (caused by oversaturation of the market with budget, low-quality games). Marketed as more of a toy than a \"video game console,\" the NES was able to find its success due, in part, to Super Mario Bros., which was offered along with a purchase of a new console, rendering it one of the best selling games of all time.</p><p>The game popularized the \"side-scrolling platformer\" genre, inspiring clones and lookalikes for several generations following its initial release. Even the NES itself found dozens upon dozens of side-scrolling platformers released for it, indicative of Super Mario Bros.'s effect on game development.</p><p>Since its release, Super Mario Bros. has been regarded as one of the most influential games of all time. It is consistently placed on official \"top games of all time\" lists, including lists from publications such as <i>Nintendo Power</i>, <i>Electronic Gaming Monthly</i>, IGN, Screw Attack, <i>Game Informer</i>, and many, many more.</p><h4>Release Date Controversy</h4><p>There is minor controversy regarding the actual date of Super Mario Bros.'s release. While the game's official release date in Japan is recorded and well known, its release date in North America is highly disputed, and even the year is uncertain. Several sources cite the release date as 1986, including video game historian Steven Kent.</p><p>Official Nintendo sources state the release date is October 18, 1985, which is reciprocated in <a href=\"/super-smash-bros-brawl/3030-20588/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-20588\"> Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>'s \"Chronicle\" section. Supposedly, the game was released coinciding with the release of the NES, however, its original release date is also lost. Other possible release dates include October 12, October 19, and another official Nintendo provided date of November 17, 1985.</p><p> </p>","rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/","id":19,"name":"CERO: All Ages"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/","id":6,"name":"ESRB: E"}],"image":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2362267-nes_supermariobros.jpg"},{"id":32012,"name":"Super Mario Bros. / Tetris / Nintendo World Cup","platforms":"Nintendo Entertainment System","summary":"A compilation of Super Mario Bros. / Tetris / Nintendo World Cup for NES","description":null,"rating":null,"image":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2260300-smbtnwcboxart.jpg"},{"id":7504,"name":"'89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai","platforms":"Nintendo Entertainment System","summary":"A fortune-telling interactive horoscope developed by Micronics and published by Induction Produce for the NES.
