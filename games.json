The overworld is varied and contains many environments including mountains, lakes, deserts, forests, caves, coastal regions, and a graveyard.

Upon defeating the boss, Link receives a heart container and a piece of the Triforce. There are a total of nine dungeons: eight containing Triforce pieces plus Ganon's fortress.</p><p>The game is also notable for its non-linearity. \"Clues\" are given sporadically by shopkeepers and other <a href=\"/non-player-character/3015-967/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-967\"> non-player characters</a>, though the incredibly poor translation means these clues are rarely useful in the English version.

This particular dungeon contains the <a href=\"/bow/3055-73/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-73\"> bow</a> and the <a href=\"/boomerang/3055-76/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-76\"> boomerang</a>, and its boss is Aquamentus, a green dragon-like creature.</li><li><b>The Moon</b> - The second dungeon is hidden inside a forest in the eastern portion of the world. The only item found in The Moon is the magical boomerang, which can be thrown further than the boomerang. The boss of The Moon is Dodongo.</li><li><b>The Manji</b> - Like The Moon, The Manji is also hidden in a forest, but to the southwestern portion of the world. This dungeon contains the <a href=\"/raft/3055-819/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-819\"> raft</a>, which allows Link to traverse water. The dungeon is guarded by the Manhandla, a large, multi-headed plant creature.</li><li><b>The Snake</b> - The fourth dungeon in the game is located directly west to the first dungeon in the game, on another small island. Here, Link finds the <a href=\"/ladder/3055-520/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-520\"> ladder</a>, which gives the player the ability to cross gaps inside dungeons. The boss of \"The Snake\" is Gleeok, a multi-headed dragon.</li><li><b>The Lizard</b> - The Lizard is located to the northeast, on top of a mountain, only accessible with the previous dungeon's ladder. Here, the player finds the <a href=\"/recorder/3055-820/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-820\"> whistle</a>, which gives Link the ability to warp between dungeons, as well as killing some types of enemies. The boss of The Lizard is Digdogger, a circular, heavily armored creature.</li><li><b>The Dragon</b> - Legend of Zelda's sixth dungeon is located to the far west of the map. In this dungeon, Link finds the <a href=\"/wand/3055-221/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-221\"> magic wand</a>, an equally powerful attack as the boomerang, but one that doesn't require <a href=\"/rupee/3055-44/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-44\"> Rupees</a> to use. The boss of The Dragon is <a href=\"/gohma/3005-7632/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-7632\"> Gohma</a>, one of the easiest bosses of the game, and one of few who has resurfaced in future games.</li><li><b>The Demon</b> - The Demon is where the whistle comes into play, an item required to open up a secret passageway beneath a lake to the west. In The Demon, the player finds the <a href=\"/candle/3055-814/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-814\"> red candle</a>, an improvement over the blue candle (found outside of dungeons), allowing Link to burn bushes and enemies indefinitely.</li><li><b>The Lion</b> - Two items are found in the game's eighth dungeon: the magic book and the <a href=\"/magic-key/3055-816/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-816\"> magic key</a>. The book improves the wand, which makes it shoot <a href=\"/fireball/3055-120/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-120\"> fireballs</a> as well, while the magical key is able to open any door in any dungeon.</li><li><b><a href=\"/death-mountain/3035-69/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-69\"> Death Mountain</a></b> - Death Mountain is the final location in the game, and thus, is the largest dungeon in the game.

It's said by developer <a href=\"/toru-iwatani/3040-93065/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93065\">Toru Iwatani</a> to represent a pizza with one missing slice as well as the general idea of a mouth eating. The player controls Pac-Man through a seemingly-endless amount of mazes, collecting <a href=\"/dot/3055-1161/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1161\">pellets</a> (or \"dots\") for points while avoiding the four ghosts (<a href=\"/blinky/3005-138/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-138\">Blinky</a>, <a href=\"/pinky/3005-144/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-144\">Pinky</a>, <a href=\"/inky/3005-245/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-245\">Inky</a>, and <a href=\"/clyde/3005-320/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-320\">Clyde</a>, each with their own unique movement patterns). If the player runs into any of the ghosts, the player loses a life. However, the player can run into a <a href=\"/power-pellet/3055-685/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-685\">power pellet</a>, which make the ghosts temporarily edible for points. This ability, which most players would consider fundamental to Pac-Man, was absent from the game until mid-way through development as Toru Iwatani and his team were fed up being constantly chased and decided to turn the tables on the ghosts.</p><p>Players can also get bonus <a href=\"/fruit/3055-382/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-382\">fruit</a> pieces which show up at random intervals in each level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up all the pellets without losing lives.</p><p>Veterans of this game noticed patterns about the four ghosts and have developed movement patterns for each level that guarantee success. While hypothetically there is no ending to this game, level 256 is considered a <a href=\"/kill-screen/3015-1191/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1191\">kill screen</a>. A bug in the routine on level 256 eliminates most of the pellets on the right side of the screen, replacing them and the maze with garbled text and graphics. It is impossible to clear that level legitimately. Because this level marks an end-point, the game can have a \"perfect play\" where the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels without losing a single life and then scoring as many points as possible on the kill screen before losing all his lives. The maximum score possible in this game is 3,333,360 points. The first person to achieve this score was Billy Mitchell on July 3, 1999.</p><h2>Development</h2><p>The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named <a title=\"Tōru Iwatani\" href=\"/toru-iwatani/3040-93065/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-93065\">Tōru Iwatani</a> over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japanese</a> title was <i>Pakkuman</i> (パックマン), inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase <i>paku-paku taberu</i> (パクパク食べる), where <i>paku-paku</i> describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.</p><p>Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, <i>kuchi</i> (口). Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience—beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time. This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute monster enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from <a title=\"Popeye\" href=\"/popeye/3025-571/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-571\">Popeye</a>. The result was a game he named Puck Man as a reference to the main character's <a title=\"Hockey puck\" href=\"/hockey-puck/3055-400/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-400\">hockey puck</a> shape.</p><p>Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the <a href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-396\">United States</a> by <a title=\"Bally Technologies\" href=\"/bally-mfg-corp/3010-3045/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-3045\">Bally</a> division <a title=\"Midway Games\" href=\"/midway-games/3010-185/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-185\">Midway</a>, which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism. The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to Western audiences.</p><h2>Impact and Legacy</h2><p>Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game – and subsequent <a title=\"Pac-Man (series)\" href=\"/maze/3015-528/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-528\">Pac-Man derivatives</a> – became a social phenomenon that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, <a title=\"Pac-Man (TV series)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_(TV_series)\" rel=\"nofollow\">an animated television series</a> and a <a title=\"Pac-Man Fever (song)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man_Fever_(song)\" rel=\"nofollow\">top-ten hit single</a>.</p><p>When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were <a href=\"/space/3035-50/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-50\">space </a>shooters, <a title=\"Space Invaders\" href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\">Space Invaders</a> being the most popular. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of <a title=\"Pong\" href=\"/pong/3025-1724/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1724\">Pong</a>. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. It is also one of the <a title=\"List of highest-grossing arcade games\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">highest-grossing video games</a> of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.</p><p>When first launched in <a href=\"/japan/3035-37/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-37\">Japan</a> by <a href=\"/namco/3010-7420/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7420\">Namco</a> in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as <a title=\"Space Invaders\" href=\"/space-invaders/3025-343/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-343\">Space Invaders</a> and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man '​s success in <a href=\"/north-america/3035-1664/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1664\">North America</a> took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic <a title=\"Defender (video game)\" href=\"/defender/3030-5536/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-5536\">Defender</a>), while they looked to a racing car game called <a title=\"Rally-X\" href=\"/rally-x/3030-2238/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2238\">Rally-X</a> as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped <a title=\"Asteroids (computer game)\" href=\"/asteroids/3030-1034/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-1034\">Asteroids</a> as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1 billion in quarters in its first year, surpassing the revenues grossed by the <a title=\"List of highest-grossing films\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films\" rel=\"nofollow\">highest-grossing film</a><a title=\"Star Wars\" href=\"/star-wars/3025-551/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-551\">Star Wars</a>.</p><p>It sold more than 350,000 arcade cabinets (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1 billion within 18 months (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide and an estimated 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). The game was also estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982.</p><p>Towards the end of the 20th century, the game's total gross in quarters had been estimated by <a title=\"Twin Galaxies\" href=\"/twin-galaxies/3010-7078/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7078\">Twin Galaxies</a> at more than 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion), making it the <a title=\"List of highest-grossing arcade games\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">highest-grossing video game</a> of all time (inflation adjusted: $7.16 billion in 2014). In January 1982, the game won the overall <a title=\"Game of the Year\" href=\"http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/Game_of_the_Year\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ref-id=\"false\">Best Commercial Arcade Game</a> award at the 1981 <a title=\"Electronic Games\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Games\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arcade Awards</a>. In 2001, it was voted the greatest video game of all time by a <a title=\"Dixons Retail\" href=\"/dixons/3010-5702/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-5702\">Dixons</a> poll in the <a href=\"/united-kingdom/3035-492/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-492\">UK</a>.</p><p>The game is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for a number of reasons: its titular character was the first original gaming <a title=\"Mascot\" href=\"/mascot/3015-1570/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1570\">mascot</a>, the game established the <a title=\"List of maze chase games\" href=\"/maze/3015-528/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-528\">maze chase game</a> genre, it demonstrated the potential of <a title=\"Player character\" href=\"/player-character/3015-968/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-968\">characters in video games</a>, it opened gaming to <a title=\"Women and video games\" href=\"/games-for-girls/3015-2469/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2469\">female audiences</a>, and it was gaming's first licensing success. In addition, it was the first video game to feature <a title=\"Power-up\" href=\"/power-up/3015-700/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-700\">power-ups</a>, and it is frequently credited as the first game to feature <a title=\"Cut scene\" href=\"/cutscene/3015-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-22\">cut scenes</a>, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and the monsters chasing each other around during those interludes, though <a title=\"Space Invaders Part II\" href=\"/deluxe-space-invaders/3030-41053/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-41053\">Space Invaders Part II</a> employed a similar technique slightly earlier. Pac-Man is also credited for laying the foundations for the <a title=\"Stealth game\" href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-24\">stealth game</a> genre, as it emphasized avoiding enemies rather than fighting them, and had an influence on the early stealth game <a title=\"Metal Gear\" href=\"/metal-gear/3030-6712/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6712\">Metal Gear</a>, where guards chase <a title=\"Solid Snake\" href=\"/solid-snake/3005-75/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-75\">Solid Snake</a> in a similar manner to Pac-Man when he is spotted.</p><p>Pac-Man has also influenced many other games, ranging from the <a href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open-world</a> <a title=\"Open world\" href=\"/sandbox/3015-453/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-453\">sandbox</a> game <a title=\"Grand Theft Auto (series)\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3030-13567/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-13567\">Grand Theft Auto</a> (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner) to early <a href=\"/first-person-perspective/3015-330/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-330\">first-person</a> shooters such as <a title=\"MIDI Maze\" href=\"/midi-maze/3030-16825/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-16825\">MIDI Maze</a> (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer <a title=\"John Romero\" href=\"/john-romero/3040-2/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-2\">John Romero</a> credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; <a title=\"Wolfenstein 3D\" href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\">Wolfenstein 3D</a> was similar in <a title=\"Level design\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_design\" rel=\"nofollow\">level design</a> and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while <a title=\"Doom (video game)\" href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\">Doom</a> had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level.</p><p> </p><h3> </h3>","rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-19/","id":19,"name":"CERO: All Ages"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/","id":6,"name":"ESRB: E"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/","id":7,"name":"PEGI: 3+"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/","id":25,"name":"CERO: A"}],"image":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/1331111-pacman_box.png","downloaded":true},{"id":11903,"name":"Frogger","platforms":"Game Boy, Genesis, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Apple II, Commodore 64, MSX, ZX Spectrum, Nintendo Entertainment System, Atari 8-bit, VIC-20, Atari 2600, ColecoVision, TI-99/4A, Intellivision, Game Boy Color, Odyssey 2, Dragon 32/64, TRS-80, Atari 5200, TRS-80 CoCo, Game.Com, Arcade, Xbox 360 Games Store, iPhone, BBC Micro, Windows Phone","summary":"Frogger is a classic arcade game with a simple objective: safely maneuver your frog across a busy highway and a deadly river without getting squished!","description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Frogger is a top-down, multi-stage action game.

Gameplay is timed, and successful completion requires navigating several contiguous stages in each level.</p><p>First, the frog must cross a highway while avoiding various automobiles. Lanes of traffic operate in alternating directions, and at different speeds. Getting squashed by a vehicle causes the player to lose one life, and restart the level.</p><p>A median separates the highway from a river. In later stages, the median is occupied by a snake which will also cause the player to lose a life if touched. The river contains alternating lanes of turtles and logs, moving in alternate directions, and at different speeds. The turtles move in groups of two or three, and every other group submerges regularly. The player must navigate over the turtles while above water to reach logs in various configurations, and repeat the process until reaching home.</p><p>Timing is critical as the player navigates the frog into one of five home slots. Missing the slot, or reaching the edge of the screen before leaping home loses the player one life, and restarts the stage. Once a home slot is filled, the stage restarts, and play resumes until all home slots are filled, causing the next level to start.</p><p>Score is kept as each frog progresses toward home, points are tallied. Additionally, optional bonus points are gained by rescuing a lady frog atop a log by hopping over her, and bringing her into a home slot without dying. Further bonus points are earned through catching briefly-appearing flies in home slots, and finishing stages early.</p><p>Later stages present the player with additional challenges from faster moving obstacles, faster submersing turtles, alligators occupying home slots briefly, snakes moving along logs, and trickier log configurations.</p><h2>Legacy</h2><p>The popular 1990s show <i>Seinfeld</i> had an episode almost entirely dedicated to <i>Frogge</i>r.

Soon after, they are given the world spanning task of collecting four Orbs of Light and defeating four fiends. The fiends went by the names of Lich, Kary, Kraken, and Tiamat. They had taken the Orbs from the rightful place they belonged and spread corruption over all the lands, skies, and seas. After many battles the Light warriors had collected items, gold and experience. When all the fiends were defeated, it was revealed that they took Garland’s corpse and sent it back in time. He had now become a mass of living evil known as Chaos. Confusingly Chaos sent the four fiends into the future where they currently plagued the world. Only when Chaos was defeated in the past and the four fiends were defeated in the present, was the world's natural balance finally restored.</p><p>Final Fantasy was originally considered overbearingly difficult. Saves only came at resting in a Town’s Inn or using an expensive item known as a House. Spells in the late game cost more than half a million gil, and had a limited number of charges that could only be replenished by resting. Monster encounters could go from simplistic to overpowering at a moment’s notice.</p><h2>Battle System</h2><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338481\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 544px\" data-ratio=\"0.77941176470588\" data-width=\"544\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-338481\"><img alt=\" Fighting wolves in the MSX version.\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 544w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/775/338481-1122909250_03.gif 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption> Fighting wolves in the MSX version.</figcaption></figure><p>Attacks were played out in turn based combat. All characters and monsters all were told what to do before the round began, be it cast a spell, use an item, or commit a basic attack, and all actions were then played out from the fastest person on the battlefield to the slowest. In the original game, some attacks could be useless. For example, if a Fighter and a Thief were both instructed to attack a goblin they would both do so. If the Thief killed him, it wouldn't stop the fighter from doing exactly as he was told by swinging his sword at the space the goblin once stood instead of at the other enemies present. This was later altered in the re-releases for the <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PSOne</a>, <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Game Boy Advance</a>, <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a>, and <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a> versions, so the attacker would automatically attack the next available target.</p><h2>Innovation</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469132-ffscreenie3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469132\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 256px\" data-ratio=\"0.875\" data-width=\"256\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:87.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/931/469132-ffscreenie3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-469132\"><img alt=\" Crafting a party from six available classes.

These classes could be upgraded by the Dragon King, to; White Wizard, Black Wizard, Red Wizard, Ninja, Knight, and Master. Players traveled the world in vehicles, such as; boats, airships, and canoes. In combat, up to 9 monsters of various types could battle the player's party. Unless they soared through the skies in an airship or strolled in a safe area like a town, 'random encounters' were always possible. In these Encounters, a band of monsters could emerge and strike the party. Mages had a limited amount of spells they could learn.</p><p>Final Fantasy had almost 20 musical tracks. Some of which, like the tune played after 'Victorious battle' and the 'Opening Theme', remained in one form or another in Final Fantasy games for decades to come.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>The music for Final Fantasy was composed by <a href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-635\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. Some of the tracks became the trademarks to the Final Fantasy series: like the \"Prelude\", played on the title screen, and the \"Victory Fanfare\", which is played after every victorious battle.</p><h2>Version Differences</h2><h3>Wonderswan and PlayStation</h3><p>The <a href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-22\">PSOne</a> release of Final Fantasy was under the title of <a href=\"/final-fantasy-origins/3030-7866/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-7866\">Final Fantasy Origins</a> and contained enhanced remakes of both Final Fantasy I and II using higher quality MIDI and cleaner 16-bit graphics. These enhanced remakes were initially ports of the <a href=\"/wonderswan/3045-65/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-65\">Wonderswan</a> re-releases that never made it to the US for various reasons, most notably because the <a href=\"/wonderswan-color/3045-54/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-54\">Wonderswan Color</a> was never released in the US. Aside from the obvious graphical face-lift, various changes exist in the PSOne version that differ from the original NES version. An easy mode was created for the original Final Fantasy (increased Gil and EXP curves), auto-re-targeting, a temporary quicksave, and the addition of new items such as <a href=\"/phoenix-down/3055-1009/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1009\">Phoenix Downs</a> (revive a fallen ally) and Gold Needles (remove petrification).</p><h3>Game Boy Advance</h3><p>Using the same enhanced graphical look of the PSOne release, the <a href=\"/game-boy-advance/3045-4/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-4\">Gameboy Advance</a> release of Final Fantasy, known as <a href=\"/final-fantasy-i-ii-dawn-of-souls/3030-17928/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-17928\">Dawn of Souls</a>, was most notable for drastically reducing the difficulty. The version also included bonus dungeons for each game, though the complex battle transitions and music quality were reduced due to the technical limitations of the system. All changes to the battle system of the PSOne release carry over, however the magic system (previously levels of magic \"slots\" with limited number of uses) was changed to use Magic Points instead. Speculative reasons for the changes include Nintendo's fear that an overly difficult RPG would turn away the younger player-base, arguably a larger portion of the overall audience than on the PSOne.</p><h3>PSP</h3><p>The <a href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-18\">PSP</a> re-release featured the same difficulty reduction and added bonus dungeons of the Gameboy Advance re-release, but featured an even bigger graphical overhaul, with various post-processing effects added such as cloud overcast and hi-res sprites (including spells). However, unlike Origins and Dawn of Souls, these two versions were not sold together and retailed individually at release for $29.99 USD each. Together, these two releases doubled the price of the initial release of both Final Fantasy Origins and Dawn of Souls ($29.99). The price, in addition to the numerous other re-releases of the games on other platforms, resulted in the game receiving much criticism from the gaming press.</p><h3>iPhone</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294180\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294180\"><img alt=\" Giant D-Pad\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Giant D-Pad\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294180-final_fantasy_i_ii_coming_to_iphone_20100120093724166.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Giant D-Pad</figcaption></figure><p>On February 25, 2010, Square-Enix released an updated version of this game onto the <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iPhone</a> and iPod Touch. Retailing for $8.99, it is essentially a port of the PSP version of the game. The graphics are higher resolution than the Dawn of Souls remake, and are essentially on-par with the sprites seen in the PSP version. In addition, the Soul of Chaos, Labyrinth of Time, and the 4 special element-based dungeons are also included (which are unlocked after defeating one of the four Elemental Masters). The game immediately rocketed up to the #2 spot on the Top Grossing Apps list.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294185\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 480px\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1294185\"><img alt=\" Big Buttons for easy pressingness\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg\" data-srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\" Big Buttons for easy pressingness\" src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg\" srcset=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg 480w, http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/61420/1294185-final_fantasy_1.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Big Buttons for easy pressingness</figcaption></figure><p>The game has a specialized control scheme for the touch screen. The <a href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\">overworld</a> has a simple D-pad overlay, and the battles are equipped with some large buttons and a simple tapping interface to select what action to perform and which enemy to perform it on. This is a highly efficient method for playing the game, but whereas in other games the player could just hold a button down to skip past the battles, it requires continued taps in this version, which can actually slow down the game. It currently sits around 4.5 stars on iTunes.</p>","rating":[{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-25/","id":25,"name":"CERO: A"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-29/","id":29,"name":"ESRB: E10+"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/","id":38,"name":"OFLC: PG"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-6/","id":6,"name":"ESRB: E"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-18/","id":18,"name":"PEGI: 7+"},{"api_detail_url":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-7/","id":7,"name":"PEGI: 3+"}],"image":"http://www.giantbomb.com/api/image/square_avatar/2361723-nes_finalfantasy.jpg"}]
